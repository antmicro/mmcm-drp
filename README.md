Mixed-Mode Clock Manager
========================

The Xilinx 7-series MMCM lets you generate multiple clocks with a defined frequency and phase, depending on the input clock that is connected as a reference.
Clock parameters are configurable via the Dynamic Reconfiguration Port (DRP).

This MMCM IP Core was generated using [LiteX](https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex/tree/2361abb12dab3099111844db317c71eb9a37d26e) (commit: `2361abb12dab3099111844db317c71eb9a37d26e`)

You can recreate the IP by running `./tools/litex_gen.py --bus axi --csr-data-width 32` in the `litex` directory.
