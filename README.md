Mixed-Mode Clock Manager
========================

Xilnx 7-series MMCM allows generation of multiple clocks with defined frequency and phase, depending on an input clock that is connected as a reference.
Clock parameters are configurable via Dynamic Reconfiguration Port (DRP).

This MMCM IP Core was generated using [LiteX](https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex/tree/2361abb12dab3099111844db317c71eb9a37d26e)    
(commit: `2361abb12dab3099111844db317c71eb9a37d26e`)

You can recreate the IP by running:   
`./tools/litex_gen.py --bus axi --csr-data-width 32`   
in the `litex` directory.
